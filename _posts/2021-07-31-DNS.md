## How it started...

As i was reading a post on the [Portswigger-Daily Swig](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/dozens-of-web-apps-vulnerable-to-dns-cache-poisoning-via-forgot-password-feature) site which talked about and referenced an older bug in DNS from 2008 and its corresponding attack method known as the [Kaminsky Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pp72gUYx00), which if you havent heard about it, i recommend a read over it as ([this](http://unixwiz.net/techtips/iguide-kaminsky-dns-vuln.html) link is a really great resource to learn about not only the attack but DNS as a whole) its a very crazy bug that i'm still shocked that was even a thing back then and the work that went into globally coordinating a fix...  

Anyways, while reading up on the topic, i started to get interested in my own setup here at home and how my DNS was configured... so i began to investigate. 

I knew i already had the ever popular `DNSoverHTTP` to Cloudflare running via Firefox and had manually entered in the  Cloudflare resolvers (`1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1`) as my DNS entries for my network interfaces on the laptop but what did that actually mean? Have i ever vetted out that the DNS was actually being sent via HTTPS/TLS as it claimed to be or did i lack any additonal configurations that were required to 'secure' my DNS on the local machine?

## Testing and monkeying around with DNS

First thing is first, going to need to baseline my system and see where i was at with my current DNS settings. We will use an Ubuntu 20.04 machine.

a quick look at a couple things i knew off the top of my head to spotcheck my DNS settings.

> ***Disclaimer*** you may find while reading that i am no master of linux or DNS so there may be better ways of doing this or "proper" ways but whatever, take it with a pinch of salt, a lime wedge and some tequilla, this is how i am doing it

The first one is the obv one, within the Network Manager via the GUI - those settings i had manually set and had pointed to `1.1.1.1 & 1.0.0.1`

Ok cool, so that is setup the way we think we want it. As i was searching around the webs, i found mention of `systemd-resolved` and how it also handles DNS. 

Quick `man resovled.conf` shows us

```
RESOLVED.CONF(5)                                                            resolved.conf                                                            RESOLVED.CONF(5)

NAME
       resolved.conf, resolved.conf.d - Network Name Resolution configuration files

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/systemd/resolved.conf

       /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/*.conf

       /run/systemd/resolved.conf.d/*.conf

       /usr/lib/systemd/resolved.conf.d/*.conf

DESCRIPTION
       These configuration files control local DNS and LLMNR name resolution.

CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE
       The default configuration is defined during compilation, so a configuration file is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults. By
       default, the configuration file in /etc/systemd/ contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator. This file can be edited
       to create local overrides.
```

And a quick look at the default file looks like this:

`/etc/systemd/resolved.conf`

```ps1
#  This file is part of systemd.
#
#  systemd is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
#  under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by
#  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or
#  (at your option) any later version.
#
# Entries in this file show the compile time defaults.
# You can change settings by editing this file.
# Defaults can be restored by simply deleting this file.
#
# See resolved.conf(5) for details

[Resolve]
#DNS=
#FallbackDNS=
#Domains=
#LLMNR=yes
#MulticastDNS=yes
#DNSSEC=allow-downgrade
#DNSOverTLS=no
#Cache=yes
#DNSStubListener=yes
#ReadEtcHosts=yes
```

Ok so we have some decent info but lets confirm what a real DNS query looks like on our system with the current setup as is before we start making any changes.

Below is a simple `nslookup` to `zx2c4.com` using `1.1.1.1` captured by wireshark.

![wireshark 1.1.1.1](/assets/img/dns/wireshark.png)

Well that looks about right, right? Maybe not... in theory, my ISP could still see my queries from what we see here and we dont want that right?!?! :D

## RESOLVED.CONF - Locking it down

As i mentioned earlier, there was some indication that the `resolved.conf` might be able to aide us in securing our requests so lets go back to that configuration for some review.

To check the status of the system and if it is using systemd/resolved

> resolvectl status

which should output something like this:

```

```

or if its not in use, will output something like this:

```
Failed to get global data: Unit dbus-org.freedesktop.resolve1.service not found.
```

## The Config

```ps1
[Resolve]
#DNS=
#FallbackDNS=
#Domains=
#LLMNR=yes
#MulticastDNS=yes
#DNSSEC=allow-downgrade
#DNSOverTLS=no
#Cache=no-negative
#DNSStubListener=yes
#ReadEtcHosts=yes
```

We see that our options are commented out by default but one in particular that sticks out 

> DNSOverTLS=no

Ubuntu makes it really easy on us to enable this functionality; uncomment the configs we want to enable, service restart and a test to see if our changes applied the way we intended. In our case, we need to adjust the `DNS=` and `DNSOverTLS=` for now.

```ps1
[Resolve]
DNS=1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1
#FallbackDNS=
#Domains=
#LLMNR=yes
#MulticastDNS=yes
#DNSSEC=allow-downgrade
DNSOverTLS=yes
#Cache=no-negative
#DNSStubListener=yes
#ReadEtcHosts=yes
```

Service restart

> systemctl restart systemd-resolved.service

Test

> nslookup zx2c4.com

```
Server:		127.0.0.53
Address:	127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	zx2c4.com
Address: 147.75.79.213
Name:	zx2c4.com
Address: 2604:1380:1:4d00::5
```

Looking above, you might notice that the `server` being used is shown as `127.0.0.53`

a quick look at `resolv.conf` will give some insight into why that is:

```ps1
cat /etc/resolv.conf 
# This file is managed by man:systemd-resolved(8). Do not edit.
#
# This is a dynamic resolv.conf file for connecting local clients to the
# internal DNS stub resolver of systemd-resolved. This file lists all
# configured search domains.
#
# Run "resolvectl status" to see details about the uplink DNS servers
# currently in use.
#
# Third party programs must not access this file directly, but only through the
# symlink at /etc/resolv.conf. To manage man:resolv.conf(5) in a different way,
# replace this symlink by a static file or a different symlink.
#
# See man:systemd-resolved.service(8) for details about the supported modes of
# operation for /etc/resolv.conf.

nameserver 127.0.0.53
options edns0 trust-ad
```

So maybe that is not the best at explaining the WHY part but the idea is when DNS is handled by systemd, it will send DNS requests to 127.0.0.53, where the `resolved` service is listening, as shown in the resolv.conf output

we can confirm the service is running by using `netstat` or `ss`


> sudo ss -ltnp


```
State        Recv-Q       Send-Q             Local Address:Port             Peer Address:Port      Process                                           
LISTEN       0            4096               127.0.0.53%lo:53                    0.0.0.0:*          users:(("systemd-resolve",pid=58866,fd=13))
```

> netstat -ltnp

```

```

Wireshark

![wireshark_2](/assets/img/dns/wireshark_2.png)

And above we see the sweet sweet TLS communications back and forth between our `1.1.1.1` and our Ubuntu system and no more snooping from my ISP, for now.
