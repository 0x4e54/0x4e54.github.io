Well, here is the intro to my own infosec site. I had been planning on making one of these for a while now but kept feeling that sense of *imposter syndrome* when it came time for actual content. Now that I have been doing a bit more actual web app testing, I found a couple things to start with and write about - maybe it'll help someone or maybe it'll confuse, their way - i'm glad to be contributing :D
