# A little something about me

```wrap
I've probably sat here trying to think of things to write in here for far too long...

I'm into a lot of things but this site is focused on my time spent on information security and sharing some of things i've found interesting along the way. 

I spun up this minimal site and will continue to adjust it as time goes on. Some info about the theme and setup below.

cheers - Nick
